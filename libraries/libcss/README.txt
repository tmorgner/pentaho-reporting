3. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibCSS, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibCSS.  Please post a bug report
in our JIRA bug-tracking system at:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/browse/PRE

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibCSS that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibCSS.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.7) is included in the distribution:

    <LibCSS-directory>/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

    http://ant.apache.org/

Ant is licensed under the terms of the Apache Software License (a
